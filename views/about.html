                        <p>
                            I have recently learned to write a biography in the third-person tense. Here is one of the examples: Aanchal is a talkative and social young woman who has always enjoyed connecting with people. After completing her secondary education, she moved to Canada in 2021, seeking for the new experiences and opportunities. Currently, she is enrolled in computer programming at Seneca College because she already learned the basis of the Java programming language in her home country, India so, she wants to continue in the same field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She also works as a concierge in a residential building located in Downtown, Toronto and the main goal of her job, is to provide excellent customer service to the residents and visitors, which also includes assisting with inquiries, requests, and ensures security of the building. She has a passion for both music and technology. She developed a love for playing the guitar at a young age when she received a guitar as a gift from her parents. She likes to spend hours in learning chords and playing her favourite songs.
